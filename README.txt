# Python Dice Roller for Symbian S60v3 devices #

A quick-and-dirty dice roller for S60v3 phones with 3 options, based on the tabletop RPGs I was playing at the time:

- D20 + Modifiers:
    Roll 1d20 +/- some number.
    Intended for Dungeons and Dragons and other d20 systems.
- Storyteller d10s:
    Roll x number of d10s. 7, 8 and 9 are one success, 10 is two successes.
    Intended for Exalted 2nd Edition.
- Sum of abstract dice:
    Rolls x number of y sided dice.
    Intended for pools of damage in D&D, for various D6 systems...
    and to save for having to fumble for a d3 or d12.
    
Due to such phones falling out of favour at the time of development, this was only ever tested on a dependable Nokia 6730 Classic. YMMV.
